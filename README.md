## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-learning-projects.git
cd deep-learning-projects
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📖 Usage
Each project directory contains its own README with specific instructions. Generally:

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Load the required dataset
3. Run the training script
4. Evaluate results using provided notebooks
